## 1. Propose a Data Visualization Project Problem
The project aims to solve the problem of understanding and analyzing patterns in cryptocurrency market behavior, including price trends, trading volumes, and market volatility. With the highly volatile nature of cryptocurrencies, there is a need to uncover significant trends and potential indicators that can help investors make informed decisions. This project will use data visualization to provide insights into how various metrics interact, with the goal of facilitating better trading and investment strategies.

## 2. Project Introduction and Motivation
The motivation for this project lies in the increasing relevance of cryptocurrencies in global finance and the challenges that come with its volatility. Cryptocurrencies have gained substantial interest, but their high risk and rapid price changes can be overwhelming for many. By analyzing data-driven insights into cryptocurrency trends, this project can provide valuable information to individuals and investors, helping them navigate the market more effectively. The insights gained could reduce risk exposure and lead to more informed, strategic investment decisions.
